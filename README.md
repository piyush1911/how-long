# how-long
A demo site for tracking how long your employees have been working for you.

## What does this site do?

Not very much! It's ugly and has limited functionality. But it can be deployed, which is pretty cool.

## Deployment

To deploy this site, you will need to add Azure login credentials to `_deploy/__main__.py`. Then, deployment is triggered by executing:

```
python -m _deploy
```
